# Productivity

My personal productivity tools.

## Getting started

```
mkdir projects
git clone git@github.com:ChaoticRoman/productivity.git
cd productivity
ln -s /home/roman/projects/productivity/bash_aliases /home/roman/.bash_aliases
```

## ChatGPT

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install openai
```

Expects `openai/.api_key` file with your API key in there. Then `gpt` command should just work.

## Google

Expects brave to be your browser.  Then `g` command should just work.
